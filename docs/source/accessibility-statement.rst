Accessibility Statement
=======================

This accessibility statement is valid for the website of `openairclim.org <https://openairclim.org>`_ owned by Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt e. V. (DLR).

As a public sector body of the German Federal Government within the meaning of EU Directive 2016/2102, we endeavour to make our websites and mobile applications accessible in accordance with the provisions set out in the German Equality for Persons with Disabilities Act (BGG) and the German Barrier-Free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV 2.0) in order to implement EU Directive 2016/2102.

Compliance status
-----------------

The accessibility requirements stem from Sections 3 (1) to (4) and 4 of BITV 2.0, adopted on the basis of Section 12d BGG.

At present, the website is partially compliant with the aforementioned requirements.
The website is currently being reviewed with regard to accessibility.
It is therefore possible that not all accessibility requirements have been fully met.
We are working on addressing all identified accessibility problems.
