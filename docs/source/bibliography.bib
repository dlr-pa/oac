  abstract = {Abstract             Contrail cirrus are a major component of the climate forcing due to air traffic. For a given contrail cirrus cover, ice water content and ice crystal shape, their impact on radiation is dependent on the number and size of ice crystals. Here we use a global climate model to study the impact of a reduction in initially formed ice crystal numbers, as may be caused by reduced soot number emissions. We find that for reduced initial ice crystal numbers the ice water content is decreased and ice crystal sizes increased, leading to a reduction in contrail cirrus optical depth and doubling the fraction of contrail cirrus that cannot be detected by satellite remote sensing. Contrail cirrus lifetimes and coverage are strongly reduced leading to significant reductions in contrail cirrus radiative forcing. The global climate impact of contrail cirrus is nonlinearly dependent on the reduction in initial ice crystal numbers. A reduction in the initial ice crystal number of 80\% leads to a decrease in contrail cirrus radiative forcing by 50\%, whereas a twofold reduction leads to a decrease in radiative forcing by approximately 20\%. Only a few contrail cirrus outbreaks explain a large percentage of the climate impact. The contrail cirrus climate impact can be effectively mitigated by reducing initial ice crystal concentrations in such outbreak situations. Our results are important for assessments dealing with mitigating the climate impact of aviation and discussions about the use of alternative fuels or lean combustion in aviation.},

  abstract = {The formation of contrails (condensation trails) from aircraft exhaust has been investigated since 1919. Related studies are reviewed. The thermodynamical foundation of the Appleman threshold criterion for contrail formation has been first described by SCHMIDT in 1940. The Schmidt/Appleman criterion is reexamined, including the effects of the conversion of part of the combustion heat into kinetic energy of the motions in the wake of the aircraft causing higher threshold temperatures for contrail formation than without this conversion. The criterion is also derived including the kinetic energy of the jet plumes but this effect changes the threshold temperature only a little. The analysis is applied for a measured test case with the so-called ATTAS aircraft and for typical modern wide-body aircraft of type B747. If the aircraft would burn liquid hydrogen (liquid methane) instead of kerosene fuel, contrails would appear at typically 10 K (4.5 K) higher ambient temperatures and would be geometrically thicker and longer. However, this does not necessarily mean that such alternative fuels have a stronger impact on climate because such fuels will cause less and larger particles with smaller optical thickness and faster sedimentation.
