OpenAirClim Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the OpenAirClim documentation!

OpenAirClim is a model for simplified evaluation of the approximate chemistry-climate impact of air traffic emissions.
The model represents the major responses of the atmosphere to emissions in terms of composition and climate change.
Development is being led by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR) and includes various research and industry partners.
The objective of OpenAirClim is to provide an open-source, standardised and computationally inexpensive method to analyse the climate impact of existing as well as future aircraft, in particular for company and (climate) policy decision-making as well as aircraft design optimisation.
Typical research questions that can be answered by using OpenAirClim relate to:

- fleet-wide scenarios, e.g. the introduction of a new aircraft type;
- aviation industry scenarios, e.g. the introduction of a new fuel type; and
- operational procedures, e.g. intermediate stop operations or flying lower/slower
