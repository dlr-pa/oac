**Liability for third party content via setting of hyperlinks**

Cross-references or rather hyperlinks ("links") to content provided by other content providers must be distinguished from DLR´s own content.
By means of hyperlinking DLR provides third-party content for use which is marked accordingly by the indication "[external]" or by a link.
Before setting the link DLR checks this third-party content if it causes possible civil or criminal liability.
However, it cannot be excluded that the third-party content providers change their content afterwards.
DLR does not constantly check the third-party content it refers to for changes made by the third-party content providers which could engender DLR´s civil or criminal liability.
