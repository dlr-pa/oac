Contrail Module
===============

A growing body of research has highlighted the major contribution of aviation to anthropogenic climate change.
To tackle this, a number of new aircraft technologies are envisioned or currently under development.
These include novel aviation fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen (H2), as well as novel propulsion technologies such as lean burn and water injection.
All of these technologies have substantially different emission profiles to conventional aircraft, in particular when it comes to contrails.
Existing models are either not yet applicable for these aircraft, or are computationally too expensive. 

Here, we describe the OpenAirClim Contrail Module (oac.cont).
The first section describes the methodology, explaining the scientific basis to the submodules.
Section 2 provides an overview of some important, general open questions.
Section 3 describes the Global Circulation Model (GCM) simulations upon which the contrail module is based.
Finally, Section 4 discusses the current limitations, future improvements and planning.

The following abbreviations are used within the text:

- oac = OpenAirClim
- oac.cont = OpenAirClim Contrail Module
- SMR = Short- & Medium-Range
- R/SMR = Regional & SMR
- RO = Regional only
- LR = Long-Range


OpenAirClim Contrail Module Methodology
---------------------------------------

The objective of the OpenAirClim Contrail Module (oac-cont) is to calculate the changes in the contrail-induced global yearly average radiative forcing and temperature due to an input emission inventory and scenario.
A simple representation of the methodology is:
