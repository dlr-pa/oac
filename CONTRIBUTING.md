# How to contribute to OpenAirClim

OpenAirClim is a joint, open-source effort.
We greatly value contributions of any kind!
However, please familiarise yourself with the process described in this document before submitting issues and pull requests.
This ensures that the development proceeded as smoothly and quickly as possible.

We value the time you invest in contributing and strive to make this process as easy as possible.
Therefore, if you have ideas on how to make this process smoother, please do let us know for example through the [discussions](https://github.com/dlr-pa/oac/discussions) tab on GitHub.

Also, if you are interested in becoming part of the core development team, feel free to reach out.

## :classical_building: OpenAirClim Governance

The development of OpenAirClim is overseen by a Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee is responsible for defining high-level roadmaps, defining the core development team, deciding on partners and agreeing on governance procedures.
Contributions to the OpenAirClim code base are overseen by the Scientific and Technical Boards.
The Scientific Board is responsible for deciding on model extensions, new processes and verification approaches.
The Technical Board decides on versioning, releases, data structures and code styles.
Engagement from users and the industry is obtained at user meetings and workshops as well as through discussions on GitHub.

## :book: Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dlr-pa/oac/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
It is in effect at all times.
We expect it to be honoured by everyone who contributes to this project. 

## :bulb: Asking Questions

Use the [discussions](https://github.com/dlr-pa/oac/discussions) tab on GitHub for general questions or requests for help with your specific project.
GitHub issues are reserved for bug reporting and feature requests.

---

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), check if you are using the latest version of the project.
If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.
We differentiate between two issue types: bug reports and feature requests.

### Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug relates to a security vulnerability.** Please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/dlr-pa/oac/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Ensure that a related issue has not already been reported** on GitHub. If it has, use this issue to add comments or further details. Please refrain from adding "+1" to issues - use reactions instead.
- If you cannot identify an open issue addressing your bug, please open a new issue. Use our `bug_report.md` template (GitHub should automatically prompt you to do so) and answer the questions there. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible and ideally a code sample or test case demonstrating the current and expected behaviour. Use [GitHub-flavoured Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for code blocks and console outputs.

### Do you have an idea for a new feature?

- Feature requests are always welcome. Since we are a small team, we cannot guarantee that your request will be accepted and we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. If you are able to help out and develop (part of) the feature yourself, please let us know in the request.
- **Do not open a duplicate feature request**. Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your requested feature, or one very similar, please use this issue.
- If you cannot find your feature request in the open issues, please open a new issue. Use our `feature_request.md` template (GitHub should automatically prompt you to do so) and answer the questions there.

## :flight_departure: Working with the Repository

OpenAirClim is hosted and shared on GitHub.
The development of the software follows the branching model shown below and uses both _protected_ and _unprotected_ branches.

![branches_oac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47030a9b-f4dd-4350-a4f1-32836f8492bf)

Protected branches include `main` and `dev` and can only be modified using Pull Requests (see [Contributing Code and Documentation](#hammer_and_wrench-contributing-code-and-documentation)).
New OpenAirClim versions are released on `main`.

Software development is carried out on the unprotected branches (e.g. feature branches for a particular task/issue) as well as on local repositories and forks.
The branches are labeled `feature/<feature-name>` for features, `bug/<bug-fix-name>` for bug fixes and `docs/<doc-name>` for changes in documentation.
Unprotected branches can be created by developers who have at least write persmissions for the repository.
These developers can be part of the core development team or external collaborators.
Before write permissions are granted, the Steering Committee will ensure that the planned work is in line with the overall short- and long-term project planning.

Possible contributors should contact someone from the OpenAirClim team, or [Stefan VÃ¶lk](mailto:stefan.voelk@dlr.de) if in doubt.
Please note that we cannot guarantee that pull requests are considered or accepted if the work was not discussed with the Steering Committee.

## :dart: Releases and Versioning

Software releases of OpenAirClim follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) numbering scheme with three digits denoting MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH changes. 
There are two competing needs which have to be balanced:
The occasional need for improvements or maintenance which breaks backward compatibility and the need for stability for existing users and developers.
Decisions about backward incompatibilities have to be taken within the OpenAirClim organisation.
Please address questions about backward compatibility and release scheduling to the Scientific and Technical Boards.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Contributing Code and Documentation

You'd like to help us add a new feature, add documentation or fix a bug?
That's amazing, you're the best! :heart:

Before starting work, please carefully read this section. 
Please also open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests). 

_Note: All contributions will be licenced under the project's [licence](https://github.com/dlr-pa/oac/blob/main/LICENSE)._

### General considerations

- **The default git branch is `main`.** Unless otherwise discussed with the core development team, use `main` to fork the repository or create a new feature branch and make a pull request against.
- **Smaller is better.** Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. It is better to submit many small pull requests than a single large one, which would take a very large time to review. **Do not refactor or reformat code unrelated to your change.**
- **Coordinate bigger changes**. For large and non-trivial changes, use an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. This is particularly important if your pull request is related to other open issues.
- **Prioritise understanding.** Write code clearly and concisely, but remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Therefore, ensure that your code is clear to the reader. Use in-line comments where necessary.
- **Update input files.** If your new code require changes to the input files (e.g. the example `config` file) or to the response surfaces, please make sure to also update these. If your new code introduces new input files, please also extend the `utils` scripts to generate example input files for debugging and testing.
- **Update the CHANGELOG** for all enhancements and bug fixes. Include the corresponding issue number and your GitHub username. Example: "Fixed error in scaling methodology. #123 @liammegill"
- **Use the pull request template** available on GitHub and ensure you have completed the checklist.

### Scientific Relevance

New features and changes to the software should be relevant to the larger scientific community.
The implementations should be scientifically sound and the used formulae should be checked for corectness, e.g. by a scientific review.
Wherever possible and meaningful, stick to [CF conventions](https://cfconventions.org/).
Please approach the Scientific Board with any issues or questions related to scientific relevance.

### Code Quality

In order to ensure readability, maintainability and a sustainable development of OpenAirClim, best practices and coding standards are a crucial part of our software development. 
For Python coding, [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is our gold standard.
We recommend the use of an automatic code formatter such as [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), which can also be used with your choice of IDE.

### Documentation

All code should be **well documented**.
In order to document python functions, classes and modules, we use [Google style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google).
From these docstrings, documentation in HTML format can be [generated automatically](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html).
The OpenAirClim documentation is found in the _docs_ directory.

### Software testing

New code should be accompanied by automated pytest test functionality.
Tests should be placed in the _tests_ directory.
Do not hesitate to contact the Technical Board for assistance.

### Dependencies

Before considering the introduction of a new dependency, ensure that the licence of the dependence and any of its dependencies are compatible with the Apache 2.0 licence that applies to OpenAirClim.
Remember that all contributions to OpenAirClim will be licenced under the project's licence.
When adding or removing dependencies, ensure that the corresponding files describing these dependencies are updated, i.e. `environment_dev.yaml` and `environment_minimal.yaml`.

### Backwards compatibility

Balancing a good user experience with fast development is not trivial.
We strive to maintain backward compatibility where possible, but note that this cannot always be guaranteed.
If your code is not backwards compatible or introduces a breaking change, this must be clearly indicated in the pull request.

### Automatic checks

To check that a pull request is up to standard, a number of automatic checks are run by GitHub Actions when you make a (draft) pull request.
A â means the checks were successful; a â that the checks were unsuccessful.
If the checks are broken because of something unrelated to the current pull request, please check if there is an open issue on this problem and otherwise create one.
This problem will have to be resolved in a separate pull request before the current pull request can be merged.

### List of authors

If you contribute to OpenAirClim and would like to be listed as an author (e.g. on Zenodo), please add your name to the list of authors in `CITATION.cff`.

## :sun_with_face: Do-s and Don't-s

Finally, some do-s and don't-s.

**Do:**
- Before starting work, open a GitHub issue to discuss what you are going to do.
- Create and use a new branch for each new development.
- Comment your code clearly in English using in-line comments and docstrings
- Use short but self-explanatory variable names (e.g. `model_input` rather than `xm`)
- Consider using a modular/functional programming style.
- Consider reusing or extending existing code.
- Synchronise your development branch with the protected branch(es) regularly in order to integrate the latest updates into your work. 
- Have fun!

**Don't:**
- Use other programming languages than the ones currently supported: Python.
- Develop without proper version control.
- Use large (memory, disk space) intermediate results
- Use hard-coded pathnames or filenames.
