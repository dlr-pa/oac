<section id="iii-definitions-of-terms">
<h2>III. Definitions of terms<a class="headerlink" href="#iii-definitions-of-terms" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act, we use the following terms, among others, in this privacy policy:</p>
<p><em>1. Personal data</em></p>
<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p><em>2. Data subject</em></p>
<p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.</p>
<p><em>3. Processing</em></p>
<p>Processing means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
<p><em>4. Restriction of processing</em></p>
<p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its future processing.</p>
<p><em>5. Profiling</em></p>
<p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
<p><em>6. Pseudonymisation</em></p>
<p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p><em>7. Controller or controller responsible for the processing</em></p>
<p>The controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
<p><em>8. Processor</em></p>
<p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
<p><em>9. Recipient</em></p>
<p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular enquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients.</p>
<p><em>10. Third party</em></p>
<p>A third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process the personal data.</p>
<p><em>11. Consent</em></p>
<p>Consent is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>
</section>
<section id="iv-general-information-on-data-processing">
<h2>IV. General information on data processing<a class="headerlink" href="#iv-general-information-on-data-processing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><em>1. Scope of the processing of personal data</em></p>
<p>We only process our users’ personal data to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The processing of our users’ personal data only takes place regularly with the user’s consent. An exception applies in cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p>
<p><em>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</em></p>
<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofar as special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and additionally on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><em>3. Data erasure and storage duration</em></p>
<p>The personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies. Data may also be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>
<p><em>4. Revocation of your consent to data processing</em></p>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<p><em>5. Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</em></p>
<p>Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries.
If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there.
We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed.
For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court.
Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes.
We have no control over these processing activities.</p>

If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user’s end device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>Our hoster(s) will only process your data to the extent that this is necessary for the fulfilment of its fulfil its performance obligations and follow our instructions with regard to this data.</p>

<p>The collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of data in log files is crucial to operation of the website. Hence, users are not granted a right to object.</p>
<p><em>3. Contact</em></p>
<p>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</p>

<p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
